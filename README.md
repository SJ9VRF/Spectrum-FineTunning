# Spectrum Fine-Tuning Process

## Step 1: Load Pre-Trained Model
Load the pre-trained language model that you will fine-tune using the Spectrum method.

## Step 2: SNR Analysis
Utilize the `SNRAnalyzer` to calculate the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for each layer of the model. This analysis helps identify which layers have higher informational content.

## Step 3: Layer Selection
Select the layers with high SNR values. These layers are considered more informative and are targeted for fine-tuning.

## Step 4: Freezing Layers
Freeze the layers with low SNR values to prevent them from updating during the fine-tuning process, saving computational resources.

## Step 5: Configure SpectrumTrainer
Set up the `SpectrumTrainer` with the selected high-SNR layers, training and evaluation datasets, and specify the output directory for saving the fine-tuned model.

## Step 6: Fine-Tuning
Begin the fine-tuning process with the `SpectrumTrainer`, focusing on updating the weights of the selected layers to improve model performance.

## Step 7: Evaluation and Deployment
After training, evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model on a validation dataset. If satisfactory, proceed to deploy the model for its intended use.
